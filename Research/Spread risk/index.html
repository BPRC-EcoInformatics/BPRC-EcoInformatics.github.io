<p>Understanding <b>the fundamental properties of the distribution and abundance of species in time and space</b> has many potential benefits for applied ecology, including both the management of problem species and the conservation of rare and threatened ones. The estimation of rate and patterns of spread is also one of the key steps in a invasive species risk assessment. Our research includes describing, modelling and predicting spatial relationships between macroecological variables and species' population distribution through time.</p>

<p>Understanding how organisms spread has long been a key focus of dispersal ecology and biogeography. Research on this topic has focused most strongly on <b>the dynamics of range changes</b>, rather than on invasion-related questions. Key questions include the following: (i) drivers and contribution of different vectors to dispersal; (ii) temporal and spatial variation in spread rates; and (iii) impact and control of spread in human-dominated ecosystems. Despite significant theoretical and conceptual progress has been made, mechanistic models that are able to predict both the temporal and spatial variation of spread, from time lag to spread acceleration, as well as how different environments can influence spread rates at different localities, are needed. </p>

<p>Our team is currently developing a spatially explicit models that link individual based models (IBM) of species spread with spatial information through GIS technology to support management and research in biosecurity and other disciplines. The modeling framework provides functionality for a wide variety of applications ranging from predictions of the spatio-temporal spread of real species and comparison of potential management strategies, to theoretical investigation of the effect habitat or climate change on population dynamics.</p><br>
