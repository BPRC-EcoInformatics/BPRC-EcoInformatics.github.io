<h3>Invasive alien speciesâ€™ impact classification </h3>
</header>

<p>Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered one of the biggest threats to biodiversity. Their ecological impacts have been reported at different levels of biological organization and at different spatial scales. Evaluating, comparing and predicting impacts of non-native species is critical for developing mitigation measures. In particular, quantifying IAS impacts can help decision makers and managers to prioritize their efforts to regulate and manage species with the highest impact on socio-economic systems. However, in order to prioritize species, they need to be ranked, which can only be done by quantifying their impact within severity categories.</p>
