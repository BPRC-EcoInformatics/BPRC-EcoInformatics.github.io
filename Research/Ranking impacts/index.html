<h3>Invasive alien species’ impact classification </h3>
</header>

<p>Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered one of the biggest threats to biodiversity. Their ecological impacts have been reported at different levels of biological organization and at different spatial scales. Evaluating, comparing and predicting impacts of non-native species is critical for developing mitigation measures. In particular, quantifying IAS impacts can help decision makers and managers to prioritize their efforts to regulate and manage species with the highest impact on ecosystems. However, in order to prioritize species, they need to be ranked, which can only be done by quantifying their impact within severity categories.</p>

Impact classification schemes
</h3>
</header>
<p>There are a myriad of available impact classifications and their results can vary greatly. That creates uncertainty about which to use. Impact scoring systems are most generally qualitative. Meaning that they verbally describe the importance of consequences of the hazard as ‘severity categories’. An example is the classification criteria used in Rovira (2016) to define species impacts were created by Phillips et al. (2008), and evaluated “the effect of the invader on the abundance of one or more native species, or on the functioning of an organism or an ecological process”. The classifications comprised four categories (none, minor, occasionally major and major).</p> 


<p>While there is an extensive literature on systems for assessing both risk and impact, there is a little agreement on how impacts should be incorporated in risk assessment and how impacts should be compared between invading taxa and ecosystems (Parker et al. 1999, Essl et al. 2011, Kumschick and Richardson 2013). Thus, there has been a drift towards creating a unified impact-scoring system, the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS), to standardize impact assessments (e.g. Nentwig et al. 2010, Sandvik et al. 2013, Blackburn et al. 2014). But, the qualitative nature of impact descriptions that characterizes the GISS, and most of the impact scoring systems, can lead to inconsistencies between assessors, as a literature review showed.</p>

<h3>
Using expert elicitation to explore Impact classification schemes
</h3>
</header>
<p>There is a large literature that emphasizes the need for systematic approaches to select assessors, elicit estimates and combine their judgements. Since systematic elicitation protocols can offset a range of predictable biases, such as experts being subject to cognitive and motivational biases that impair their ability to accurately report their true beliefs (Burgman 2005, McBride et al. 2012). In Rovira, (2016) a structured expert elicitation process was carried and the results showed to increase agreement between the experts. Future research should focus on developing generic quantitative framework for expert elicitation and impact classification. </p>
