<h3> What is a species distribution model? (SDM) </h3>
</header>
<p><b>Species distribution models (SDMs)</b> also known as climate envelope-models, habitat models or
ecological niche models, are numerical tools for modeling, evaluating and predicting species
potential distributions in space and time. These numerical techniques support a rich diversity of
applications, for example, evaluating the potential of an invasive species to establish in a particular
region, identifying areas that should be prioritized for conservation, or determining the
distribution of disease vectors for targeting health programmes. SDMs can also be used to project
distributions and impacts from future land-use or climate scenarios. There are many
 reasons we want to know where particular species can occur. However,
there are also many questions regarding the methodologies we use to do so. <br></p>

<h3>How do species distribution models work?</h3>
</header>
<p>
Developing a species distribution model begins with collecting observations of species
occurrences. Species occurrences are places where we know a species has been found. These
occurrences are mostly point-based and come from sources such as museum records, national
and international databases and observations of experts in the field. The question is how do we go
from specific places where individuals of a species have been observed to producing a map that
gives an estimate of the distribution of that species in other areas of interest? This is where
species distribution models come into play.</p>

<p>SDMs link current locations of species occurrences with values of environmental
predictor variables (such as temperature and precipitation) at these locations to estimate the
<b>probability of a species occurring </b> as some function of the environmental conditions of that location.
The predicted species distribution can then be projected geographically on a map. For every point
in the landscape, the model estimates the probability of a species occurring there. This can either
be displayed as a binary outcome, in other words, as a presence/absence map, or as a probability
on a scale from 0 to 1. It is important to note that these maps do not show actual occurrences of a
species, but highlight areas that have similar environmental conditions to areas where the species
has already been found. <b>Thus the map provides an estimation of where a species might find
suitable or unsuitable habitat or climate</b> . This does not necessarily mean that a species actually
exists or does not exist in the area.</p>

<h3>Niche conservatism, a source of uncertainty in SDMs </h3>
</header>
<p>One assumption for predicting species distributions using correlative SDMs, is that species occupy
all or most of the suitable geographic areas in its native range. A second necessary assumption for
these statistical models is that the species realized environmental niche, as determined from
empirical observations, remains stable over time and space, a phenomenon called ecological niche
conservatism. The validity of these assumptions remains a matter of contention.</p>
<br>

<h3>Niche shifts in an invasive species context
</h3>
</header>
<p>Correlative SDMs implicitly focus on estimation of a species realized and fundamental niche
based on its current geographical distribution. The methods rely on the niche conservatism
assumption which implies that <b>species tend to grow and survive under the same environmental
conditions in native and invaded ranges</b>. However, this assumption has been challenged recently
by evidence of niche shifts in some invasive species. One reason for uncertainty regarding niche
conservatism is that species ecological flexibility and/or genetic adaptation can impact the
observed degree of conservatism and the accuracy of predicted species distributions. For
example, niche shift may result from changes in the realized niche when species spreads into
habitats in the invaded range that are climatically distinct from those occupied in the native range.
This may happen if some constraint, such as a certain predator, parasite or disease is present in
the native area but not in the invasive area. Alternatively a niche-shift could involve both the
fundamental and realized niches, if, for example, the genetically-determined environmental
tolerances of a species were to respond to selection during range expansion.</p>
<p>Accurately characterizing the nature of the niche changes between the native and invaded range is
crucial to correctly anticipate species distribution and manage that species. If an invasive species
conserves the environmental preferences of their native range, SDMs should accurately forecast
suitable areas in the non-native range and can serve as a basis for prioritizing areas at high risk of
invasion. On the contrary, if a niche shift has occurred, the invaderâ€™s potential habitats should be
considered carefully since it can establish in environments not occupied in the native range making
it difficult to prioritize areas and therefore hampering its management.</p>

<p> The Ecological informatics lab have been developing R scripts to clean data, run SDMs, analyze the niche dynamics of particular species
and apply ensemble modelling to assess the uncertainty present in SDMs.</p>
