<subtitle>In Ecology, an invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal that is not native to a specific location, but has been introduced by human action. Invasive species have a tendency to spread and cause damage to the environment, human economy and human health.</subtitle>

<p>Invasive alien species can do <strong>irreparable harm</strong> to both indigenous and managed ecosystems. The negative ecological impacts of invasive species have been reported at multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from genetic and evolutionary changes in individual organisms, disruption of native population dynamics, local and regional extinctions of native species, to the alteration of biochemical pools and fluxes of nutrients, fire regimes and water quality. Invasive species have now affected nearly every type of ecosystem on the planet and pose one of the <strong>biggest threats to biodiversity worldwide</strong> and associated ecosystems services. </p>

While international imperatives to protect human health and productive ecosystems, as well as preserve biodiversity, are clear, pressure to maintain global food security is growing. Various publications report <strong>large sums of money</strong> spent towards detection, control and eradication of invasive species. According to De Poorter et al. (2007), USD 1.5 trillion/year is incurred globally (5% of the global economy), the majority of which is due to crop losses and the application of herbicides and pesticides to reduce invasive weeds and pests. </p>

<p>The term <strong>biosecurity</strong> refers to a coordinated approach, generally led by a particular governmental authority or network of authorities, to understand and manage natural and human-caused threats to a range of biological resources (Quinlan et al., 2015). The main
aim of biosecurity authorities is to make informed decisions based on trade-offs between preventing species invasions while sustaining or facilitating trade levels and tourism. New Zealand is an island nation that is geographically isolated from any significant landmass. For this reason the country is free from many pests and diseases that damage productive and natural ecosystems or endanger human and animal health.</p> 

<p><strong>Athough eradicating most invasive species is virtually impossible</strong> some ways to minimize their harmful consequences are to <strong>recognize potential invasive species threats</strong> before they arrive. In particular, <strong>modelling and forecasting</strong> the establishment and spread of invasive species helps support and improve international biosecurity decision-making. It informs pre-border prevention measures, and provides risk maps and models for surveillance, eradication, mitigation and control of invasive species. Some of the methods described on this website can assist the recognition process. </p></section>
