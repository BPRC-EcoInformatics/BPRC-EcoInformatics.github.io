<subtitle>All around you are animals, insects, plants, bacteria. You may take it for granted that they have always been there. But many common species are not native to the environments in which they are now found</subtitle>

<p><strong>Invasive species</strong> are any species that are introduced in a location outside their natural geographical range, where they become established and then proliferate and spread to the detriment of natural systems and human interests.</p>

<p>Invasive alien species can do <strong>irreparable harm</strong> to both indigenous and managed biological ecosystems, as well as to human and animal health. The negative ecological impacts of invasive species have been reported at multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from genetic and evolutionary changes in individual organisms, disruption of native population dynamics, local and regional extinctions of native species, to the alteration of biochemical pools and fluxes of nutrients, fire regimes and water quality. Invasive species have now affected nearly every type of ecosystem on the planet and pose one of the <strong>biggest threats to biodiversity worldwide</strong> and associated ecosystems services. </p>

<p>Some of the <strong>large epidemics</strong> that caused humanitarian and economic crises, such as malaria (Plasmodium spp.), Bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) and West Nile virus (Flavivirus spp.), are known to be spread by invasive species. While the traditional international imperatives to protect human health and productive ecosystems, as well as preserve biodiversity, are clear, pressure to maintain world food security is growing. Various publications report <strong>large sums of money</strong> spent with respect to the cost of detection, control and eradication of invasive species. According to De Poorter et al. (2007), USD 1.5 trillion/year is incurred globally (5% of the global economy), the majority of which is due to crop losses and the application of herbicides and pesticides to reduce invasive weeds and pests. </p>

<p><strong>Eradicating most invasive species is virtually impossible</strong> in an era of globalization. And as climate change and anthropogenic land-use change pushes more species out of their home ranges and into new areas, the number of so-called invaders is likely to multiply exponentially. The on-going, global mass invasion by invasive species comprises a rapidly growing array of unique ecological, economic and social challenges of unprecedented magnitude.</p>

<p>One way to minimize surprises is to <strong>recognize potential invasive species threats</strong> before they arrive by ranking the thousands of possible invasive alien pests with respect to their risk of establishment. In particular, <strong>modelling and forecasting</strong> the establishment and spread of invasive species helps support and improve international biosecurity decision-making. It informs pre-border prevention measures, and provides risk maps and models for surveillance, eradication, mitigation and control of invasive species. Some of the methods described on this web-page can assist the recognition process. </p></section>
