						<subtitle>The <b>Ecological informatics</b> lab is an open, voluntary collaboration of researchers led by <a href="http://bioprotection.org.nz/users/sue-worner"> Assoc. Prof. Susan P. Worner</a> at <a href="http://bioprotection.org.nz">Bio-Protection Research Centre</a>, New Zealand. As a trans-disciplinary group, we aim to produce new skills, software codes, publications, and services that involve the <b>ecoclimatic assessment of the distribution and spread of invasive species</b>, particularly insects.  Novel analysis and prediction methods from the disciplines of ecological informatics and computational intelligence, as well as standard approaches, are used. We bring critical analytical techniques to the the study of invasion ecology and biosecurity risk management; areas characterized by complexity and uncertainty.</subtitle>
